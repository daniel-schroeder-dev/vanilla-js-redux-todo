# VanillaJS Todo List with Redux and Webpack

In order to really nail down some core concepts that exist in the React ecosystem, I'm going to build some small apps that use React-like techniques but don't use React. This is my first attempt. It's a standard Todo List app but using Redux for state management, Webpack to allow me to write in a modular style, and 'components' that 'render' each time the Redux state changes. There is no virtual dom or optimizations, and I didn't bother to use much styling. Really just trying to get comfortable with the core modern web stack.
